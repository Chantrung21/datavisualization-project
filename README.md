## Project Overview
- This project presents an advanced interactive visualization platform for exploring Australia's national traffic penalty data from 2008 to 2024.
- Leveraging the powerful capabilities of D3.js, the dashboard transforms complex enforcement metrics into intuitive visual narratives that reveal compelling patterns and trends across fines, charges, and arrests.
- Users can deeply analyze temporal evolution, geographical distributions between states and territories, and demographic variations in penalty enforcement.
- The comprehensive dataset, authoritatively sourced from the **Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics** (BITRE), enables robust exploration of how traffic enforcement strategies and outcomes have evolved over a 16-year period, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and public stakeholders alike.



## StoryBoard
The project website is structured into five main pages that guide users through different stages of exploring Australia’s road safety enforcement data. Each page has a distinct purpose, contributing to the overall narrative of fairness and transparency in enforcement across jurisdictions.

### 1. Home Page
Introduces the project background, motivation, and objectives. It explains the purpose of analysing enforcement data from 2008–2024 and how the visualizations promote transparency and understanding of road safety policies.

### 2. National Overview Page
Provides a nationwide perspective on enforcement trends. Features an interactive map of Australia showing penalty distribution across eight jurisdictions and a line chart illustrating national trends from 2008 to 2024.

### 3. State Trends Page
Allows comparison of penalty trends between jurisdictions. Includes a multi-line chart showing total penalties by state and a histogram displaying penalty distribution, helping users identify how enforcement intensity changes over time.

### 4. Fairness Comparison Page
Focuses on evaluating fairness in enforcement. Displays two bar charts — one showing total penalties and another showing penalties per 10,000 driver licences, allowing population-adjusted comparisons across states.

### 5. About Page
Provides information about the project group, including group name, member details, and sections on data governance, and project limitations, ensuring transparency and ethical compliance.



## Datasets Used

### 1. Data Source
We collected 2 datasets for this project:
- police_enforcement_2024_fines.csv: was collected from [**BITRE Website**](https://catalogue.data.infrastructure.gov.au/dataset/road-safety-enforcement-data)
- Total_licences_by_jurisdiction.csv: was manually entered from [**BITRE Dashboard**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTAxY2EyOTAtYTdhMS00NTRiLWI0NDktM2U1ZDI0NzY0ZTU5IiwidCI6ImFhMjFiNjQwLWJhYzItNDU2ZC04NTA1LWYyY2MwN2Y1MTc4NCJ9) to collect total licences of each jurisdiction from 2010 - 2024.
### 2. Final Datasets
After processing by using KNIME Workflow, this project mainly uses two datasets, including:
- Penalties_process.csv: National Overview, State Trends, and Fairness Comparison pages.
- Penalties_per_10,000_licences_processed.csv: Fairness Comparison page. 



## GenAI Usage Statement

This project used **GenAI** to support specific aspects of development.  
Below is the full transparent disclosure:

### ✔ **1. Data Processing**
GenAI was used to:
- Clarify KNIME node functions  
- Validate transformation logic  
- Check formula correctness  
All workflows were manually executed and implemented by team members.

### ✔ **2. Code Assistance**
GenAI was used for:
- Debugging guidance  
- Syntax clarification  
- Suggestions for improving tooltip, hover, filtering logic  
All final code was manually written, edited, and tested by the group.

### ✔ **3. Website Development & Design Support**
GenAI assisted with:
- Layout suggestions (spacing, colour choice, typography)
- Writing and improving narrative sections  
- Best practices for accessibility  

No full components or pages were generated by AI without modification.

### ✔ **4. Documentation Writing**
Used to:
- Improve clarity, grammar, and spelling mistakes  
- Structure sections in README and Design Book
